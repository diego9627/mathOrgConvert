This handout will cover three common techniques for dealing with
functional equations.

Techniques
==========

Injectivity / Surjectivity
--------------------------

A function $f$ is *injective* if, whenever $f(a) = f(b)$, we
have $a = b$. A function $f$ is *surjective* if for all $r$
in the codomain of $f$, there is some $x$ such that
$f(x) = r$. (So if $f$ is a real-valued function, $f$ is
surjective if each real number is in the range of $f$.)  
  
[[[**Example 1.** The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
satisfies $x + f(x) = f(f(x))$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
Find all solutions of the equation $f(f(x)) = 0$.]]]  
  
(((**Solution.** If $f(x) = f(y)$ for some $x$ and $y$, then
$x = f(f(x)) - f(x) = f(f(y)) - f(y) = y$, so $f$ is injective.
Setting $x = 0$ gives $0 + f(0) = f(f(0))$. Since $f$ is
injective, this means $f(0) = 0$. Thus, $f(f(0)) = 0$, so
$x = 0$ is a solution to $f(f(x)) = 0$. It is also the only
solution, since $f(f(x)) = 0 = f(f(0))$ implies $f(x) = f(0)$,
so $x = 0$.)))  
  
[[[**Example 2.** (ISL 2002) Find all functions $f$ from the reals
to the reals such that \[f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x)\] holds for
all real $x$ and $y$.]]]  
  
(((**Solution.** If $y = -f(x)$, then
$f(f(-x) - x) = f(0) - 2x$. Since $f(0) - 2x$ is surjective, so
is $f(x)$. Take $c$ so that $f(c) = 0$, and set $x = c$.
We have $f(y) = 2c + f(f(y) - c)$. Since $f$ is surjective,
$f(y)$ takes on all real values, so for all $z$, we have
$z = 2c + f(z - c)$. Thus, $f(z) = z - c$ for all $z$. It is
easy to verify that any function of this form satisfies the functional
equation.)))

Easy Values
-----------

When approaching a functional equations, there are a number of simple
values that one should try substituting, like $x = 0$, $x = 1$,
or $x = y$.  
  
[[[**Example 3.** Find all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
such that $f(xf(y)+y) = f(x)f(y) + y$ for all real $x$ and
$y$.]]]  
  
(((**Solution.** Substitute $x = 0$ to get $f(y) = f(0)f(y) + y$
for all $y$. Setting $y = 0$ yields $f(0) = f(0)^2$, so
$f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$. If $f(0) = 1$, then
$f(y) = f(0)f(y) + y = f(y) + y$ for all $y$, so $y = 0$ for
all $y$, which is absurd. Thus, $f(0) = 0$, so $f(y) = y$
for all $y$. It is easy to verify that this function satisfies the
functional equation.)))

Cauchy’s Equation
-----------------

[[[Often, functional equations get reduced to something of the form
$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$. If some weak condition holds, we can
conclude that $f(x) = cx$ for some constant $c$. In particular,
if we can show that $f$ is continuous, that $f$ is monotonic
over some interval, or that $f$ is bounded from above or below over
some interval, then $f(x) = cx$ for all $x$. Here, we will show
that if $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and $f$ is increasing over
$\mathbb{R}$, then $f(x) = cx$ for some $c$. (The other
cases are left as an exercise.)]]]  
  
Setting $x=y=0$ gives $f(0) = 0$. For any positive integer
$n$ and any real $x$, we have
$f(\underbrace{x + x + \cdots + x}_n) = \underbrace{f(x) + f(x) + \cdots + f(x)}_n$,
so $f(nx) = nf(x)$ for all positive integers $n$. Additionally,
since $0 = f(-x + x) = f(-x) + f(x)$, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$
for all $x$, whence $f(nx) = nf(x)$ for all integers $n$.
Additionally, we have $f(n(x/n)) = n f(x/n)$, so
$f(x/n) = f(x)/n$ for each integer $n$. It follows that for any
rational $q = \frac{m}{n}$, we have
$f(qx) = f(mx/n) = mf(x/n) = (m/n)f(x) = qf(x)$.  
  
Let $c = f(1)$. We have $f(q) = qf(1) = cq$ for all rational
$q$. Take any real number $x$. For any positive real number
$\epsilon$, we can find rationals $r$ and $s$ such that
$r < x < s$, and $r,s \in (x - \epsilon/c, x + \epsilon/c)$. We
have $f(r) = cq \leq f(x) \leq f(s) = cs$. Thus,
$c(q - x) \leq f(x) - cx \leq c(s - x)$. Since
$|q-x| < \epsilon/c$ and $|s - x| < \epsilon/c$, we have
$|f(x) - cx| < \epsilon$. Since this holds for each positive
$\epsilon$, we must have $f(x) = cx$ for all $x$, as
desired.

Additional Tips
---------------

1.  (((When you get a solution for the functional equation, don’t forget
    to verify that the solution works.)))

2.  Often you will be able to deduce that a function $f$ satisfying
    the functional equation always equals one function or some
    other—say, you may deduce $f(x)^2 = x^2$, and conclude that for
    all $x$, $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = -x$. From this, you
    cannot conclude directly that $f(x) = x$ for all $x$ or
    $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$.
